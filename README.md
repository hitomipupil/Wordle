# Wordle: Country Edition

## About
This is a Wordle-inspired game where players guess a 5-letter country name. Unlike the traditional Wordle, only valid 5-letter country names are allowed as guesses.

## How to Play
1. Enter a 5-letter country name.
2. If the input is not a valid country name, you must delete it and try again.
3. After submitting a valid guess:
   - Green: The letter is in the correct position.
   - Yellow: The letter is in the answer but in a different position.
   - Gray: The letter is not in the answer.
4. You have up to 6 attempts to guess the correct country.
5. The answer changes every time you reload the page.

## Features
